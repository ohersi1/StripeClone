Things I learned or practiced in this project:

* More useState practice
* Introduced to useRef and practiced useRef
* Refactored more code to adhere to the DRY principle
* Expanded my knowledge on useContext as it was used expansively in this project
* Got more practice mapping over static data in an object
* Introduced to the aside html tag for the first time and understood why it is used in Modals and Sidebars for example
* Got more practice using conditional rendering inside className attributes
